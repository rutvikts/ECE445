2/19/24 - started researching necessary components to build the drivetrain portion of the PCB

Microcontroller: STM32F401RBT6
PWM: Based of STM32F401RBT6 Data Sheet it looks like you can utilize the TIMx Pins for PWM
Any of these general-purpose timers can be used to generate PWM outputs. Mainly TIM2, TIM3, TIM4 and TIM5
H-Bridge: TI DRV8212P 12V PWM control 
GPIO: for output to DC motor from H-Bridge and input from encoder to Microcontroller

On the microcontroller
TIM2, TIM3, TIM4, TIM5 all have independent DMA request generation. They are capable of handling quadrature (incremental) encoder signals and the digital outputs from 1 to 4 hall-effect sensors

2/29/24
Ordered necessary parts for our project.


3/4/2024: created schematics for buck converters 3.3V .15A and 5V 1.2A

3/19/2024: Revised Design Doc

3/24/2024: Created Bumper Cad drawing to be 3D printed and used on limit switches

3/25/2024: Updated Bumper Cad Drawings to make it easier to 3D print and test

3/27/2024: Created Cad drawing for PCB housing

3/28/2024: Updated Bumper Cad Drawing

4/8/2024: Got limit switches working and showing proper voltage when pressed thanks to https://www.ebay.com/itm/333999755279

4/11/2024: started work on limit switch code on STM32. Started with implementing it in the main loop. Tried to implement STM32Cube files in C++ which was a failure

4/14/2024: Transitioned to writing files in C which helped me make progress. Was able to get the limit switch to turn on an LED on the STM dev board

4/15/2024: Transitioned to treating limit switch input as an interrupt which allowed me to keep an LED consistently on once the switch is pressed

4/16/2024: Got the limit switch code to halt the PWM signal until the reset button is pressed which completed the high level requirement.

4/22/2024: started trying to get the robot moving at variable speeds. Figured out that we needed to appropriately calibrate the motor controllers

4/23/2024: Continued work on STM to try and get the robot moving properly

4/24/2024 Got the STM to control the robot and was able to get the robot to drive around.

4/25-5/1: report writing and clean up
