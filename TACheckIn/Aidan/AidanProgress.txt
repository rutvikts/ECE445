2/19/24 - started researching necessary components to build the drivetrain portion of the PCB

Microcontroller: STM32F401RBT6
PWM: Based of STM32F401RBT6 Data Sheet it looks like you can utilize the TIMx Pins for PWM
Any of these general-purpose timers can be used to generate PWM outputs. Mainly TIM2, TIM3, TIM4 and TIM5
H-Bridge: TI DRV8212 12V PWM control 
GPIO: for output to DC motor from H-Bridge and input from encoder to Microcontroller

On the microcontroller
TIM2, TIM3, TIM4, TIM5 all have independent DMA request generation. They are capable of handling quadrature (incremental) encoder signals and the digital outputs from 1 to 4 hall-effect sensors
